# Boston Celtics Performance Analysis (1990-2025)

## Note before diving into this project.
This is my first Data Science related project, so it might be a little rough... Everyone has to start somewhere.

## Overview
This project analyzes the Boston Celtics' performance from 1990 to 2025, my goal with this project was to clearly highlight the different peroids of performance for the Boston Celtics, the way I have decided to go around doing this is analysing the Finishing Score in direct relation to the Top Player Win Shares, of which there seem to be a direct correlation.

## Key Findings
- **Finish Score**: Normalized finish place (% of teams ahead, lower = better) shows progression/decline over time.
- **Top WS**: The top player’s Win Shares (e.g., Larry Bird, Jayson Tatum) strongly correlates with better finishes.
- **Trends**: Clear peaks during Bird’s era (early 90s), the 2008 championship, and Tatum’s rise (2020s), with declines in between.
